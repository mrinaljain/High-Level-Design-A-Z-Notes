# SQL

- SQL Database are very fast in reads because its easier to reach any memory location , because size of every storage is fixed(reserved).

- memory wastage is there  because it keeps lots of reserved space.


# No SQL

- No-Sql DB can have variable size entery , so we can-not have a reserved amount of space at every cell, otherwise storage can be wasted.
